For anyone who loves Bearded Themes - Surprising Blueberry, I used Sublime's ayu dark theme and color scheme as a templates and put Surprising Blueberry colors in them. Only tested with Odin lang, it's likely to have colors that do not match the theme for other languages. You could make a pull request or let me know if you want to theme some of those colors.

Recommended fonts:
1. M+CodeLat50/M+CodeLat60 Light (50 is narrow, 60 is wide)
2. Hasklig Light (NOT Nerd Fonts version)
3. Cascadia Code Light

The other file is just my settings for the HighlightWord Sublime plugin (you can get it with Package Control). It's themed to go with the Subliming Blueberry, and it allows you to do highlights in your comments. A bit tacky but if you want it, it looks something like the following (and is customizable):
